# Basic Front End Project
This project was my first ever creation taking a look into coding with html css and javascript
It includes a text box to enter your next to do task and a button to add the task to the list. The list is displayed below the textbox along woth a delete button which can delete the added task.

## Try it yourself
clone the repository and run the html code to take a look at the UI.
